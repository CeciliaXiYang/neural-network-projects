Each y value is converted into a sparse vector with a length of 47, full of zeros except with a 1 in the column for the letter (integer) that the pattern represents.\n",

    "- Train the model on padded sentences rather than random sequences of characters.\n",
    "- Increase the number of training epochs to 100 or many hundreds.\n",
    "- Add dropout to the visible input layer and consider tuning the dropout percentage.\n",
    "- Tune the batch size, try a batch size of 1 as a (very slow) baseline and larger sizes from there.\n",
    "- Add more memory units to the layers and/or more layers.\n",
    "- Experiment with scale factors (temperature) when interpreting the prediction probabilities.\n",
