    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapting the learning rate for your stochastic gradient descent optimization procedure can increase performance and reduce training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this is called learning rate annealing or adaptive learning rates. Here we will call this approach a learning rate schedule, were the default schedule is to use a constant learning rate to update network weights for each training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and perhaps most used adaptation of learning rate during training are techniques that reduce the learning rate over time. These have the benefit of making large changes at the beginning of the training procedure when larger learning rate values are used, and decreasing the learning rate such that a smaller rate and therefore smaller training updates are made to weights later in the training procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the effect of quickly learning good weights early and fine tuning them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two popular and easy to use learning rate schedules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decrease the learning rate gradually based on the epoch.\n",
    "- Decrease the learning rate using punctuated large drops at specific epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will look at how you can use each of these learning rate schedules in turn with Keras."

    "Keras has a time-based learning rate schedule built in.\n",

    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "LearningRate = LearningRate * 1/(1 + decay * epoch)\n",

    "When the decay argument is specified, it will decrease the learning rate from the previous epoch by the given fixed amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we use the initial learning rate value of 0.1 and the decay of 0.001, the first 5 epochs will adapt the learning rate as follows:\n",

    "- **Increase the initial learning rate.** Because the learning rate will very likely decrease, start with a larger value to decrease from. A larger learning rate will result in a lot larger changes to the weights, at least in the beginning, allowing you to benefit from the fine tuning later.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Experiment with different schedules.** It will not be clear which learning rate schedule to use so try a few with different configuration options and see what works best on your problem. Also try schedules that change exponentially and even schedules that respond to the accuracy of your model on the training or test datasets.\n"
