    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization is a big part of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to Use Keras Models in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras models can be used in scikit-learn by wrapping them with the **KerasClassifier** or **KerasRegressor** class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these wrappers you must define a function that creates and returns your Keras sequential model, then pass this function to the **build_fn** argument when constructing the KerasClassifier class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def create_model():\n",
    "\t...\n",
    "\treturn model\n",
    "\n",
    "model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor for the KerasClassifier class can take default arguments that are passed on to the calls to model.fit(), such as the number of epochs and the batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def create_model():\n",
    "\t...\n",
    "\treturn model\n",
    "\n",
    "model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, nb_epoch=10)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor for the KerasClassifier class can also take new arguments that can be passed to your custom create_model() function. These new arguments must also be defined in the signature of your create_model() function with default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def create_model(dropout_rate=0.0):\n",
    "\t...\n",
    "\treturn model\n",
    "\n",
    "model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, dropout_rate=0.2)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the scikit-learn [wrapper API](http://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/) in Keras documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use Grid Search in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search is a model hyperparameter optimization technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn this technique is provided in the **GridSearchCV** class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing this class you must provide a dictionary of hyperparameters to evaluate in the param_grid argument. This is a map of the model parameter name and an array of values to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, accuracy is the score that is optimized, but other scores can be specified in the score argument of the GridSearchCV constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the grid search will only use one thread. By setting the **n_jobs** argument in the GridSearchCV constructor to -1, the process will use all cores on your machine. Depending on your Keras backend, this may interfere with the main neural network training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GridSearchCV process then construct and evaluate one model for each combination of parameters. Cross validation is used to evaluate each individual model and the default of 3-fold cross validation is used, although this can be overridden by specifying the cv argument to the GridSearchCV constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of defining a simple grid search:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "param_grid = dict(nb_epochs=[10,20,30])\n",
    "grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, n_jobs=-1)\n",
    "grid_result = grid.fit(X, Y)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once completed, you can access the outcome of the grid search in the result object returned from grid.fit(). The best_score_ member provides access to the best score observed during the optimization procedure and the best_params_ describes the combination of parameters that achieved the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to use Keras models with scikit-learn and how to use grid search in scikit-learn, letâ€™s look at a bunch of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples will be demonstrated on a small standard machine learning dataset called the Pima Indians onset of diabetes classification [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes). This is a small dataset with all numerical attributes that is easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the dataset and place it in your currently working directly with the name pima-indians-diabetes.csv.\n",
    "As we proceed through the examples in this post, we will aggregate the best parameters. This is not the best way to grid search because parameters can interact, but it is good for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on Parallelizing Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples are configured to use parallelism (n_jobs=-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error like the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "INFO (theano.gof.compilelock): Waiting for existing lock by process '55614' (I am process '55613')\n",
    "INFO (theano.gof.compilelock): To manually release the lock, delete ...\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kill the process and change the code to not perform the grid search in parallel, set n_jobs=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Tune Batch Size and Number of Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first simple example, we look at tuning the batch size and number of epochs used when fitting the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch size in iterative gradient descent is the number of patterns shown to the network before the weights are updated. It is also an optimization in the training of the network, defining how many patterns to read at a time and keep in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs is the number of times that the entire training dataset is shown to the network during training. Some networks are sensitive to the batch size, such as LSTM recurrent neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will evaluate a suite of different mini batch sizes from 10 to 100 in steps of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full code listing is provided below."

    "\n",
    "- **k-fold Cross Validation.** You can see that the results from the examples in this post show some variance. A default cross-validation of 3 was used, but perhaps k=5 or k=10 would be more stable. Carefully choose your cross validation configuration to ensure your results are stable.\n",
    "- **Review the Whole Grid.** Do not just focus on the best result, review the whole grid of results and look for trends to support configuration decisions.\n",
    "- **Parallelize.** Use all your cores if you can, neural networks are slow to train and we often want to try a lot of different parameters. Consider spinning up a lot of AWS instances.\n",
    "- **Use a Sample of Your Dataset.** Because networks are slow to train, try training them on a smaller sample of your training dataset, just to get an idea of general directions of parameters rather than optimal configurations.\n",
    "- **Start with Coarse Grids.** Start with coarse-grained grids and zoom into finer grained grids once you can narrow the scope.\n",
    "- **Do not Transfer Results.** Results are generally problem specific. Try to avoid favorite configurations on each new problem that you see. It is unlikely that optimal results you discover on one problem will transfer to your next project. Instead look for broader trends like number of layers or relationships between parameters.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility is a Problem.** Although we set the seed for the random number generator in NumPy, the results are not 100% reproducible. There is more to reproducibility when grid searching wrapped Keras models than is presented in this post."
