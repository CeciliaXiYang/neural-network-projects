    "The problem of automatically identifying objects in photographs is difficult because of the near infinite number of permutations of objects, positions, lighting and so on. It’s a really hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a well studied problem in computer vision and more recently an important demonstration of the capability of deep learning. A standard computer vision and deep learning dataset for this problem was developed by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 photos divided into 10 classes (hence the name CIFAR-10). Classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats and so on. The dataset is split in a standard way, where 50,000 images are used for training a model and the remaining 10,000 for evaluating its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photos are in color with red, green and blue components, but are small measuring 32 by 32 pixel squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "State of the art results are achieved using very large Convolutional Neural networks. Model performance is reported in classification accuracy, with very good performance above 90% with human performance on the problem at 94% and state-of-the-art results at 96% at the time of writing."

I would expect that performance gains can be achieved by significantly raising the number of training epochs.\n",

    "- **Deeper Network Topology.** The larger network presented is deep, but larger networks could be designed for the problem. This may involve more feature maps closer to the input and perhaps less aggressive pooling. Additionally, standard convolutional network topologies that have been shown useful may be adopted and evaluated on the problem."
